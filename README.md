# Sentinel Detection KQL Queries

Welcome to the **Sentinel Detection KQL Queries** repository!  
This repository is a collection of advanced Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries for use in [Microsoft Sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel) and other Azure Log Analytics workspaces.

The goal is to help security teams **detect, hunt, and respond** to prevalent attack techniques across the kill chain, covering areas such as data exfiltration, defense evasion, persistence, and privilege escalation.
